# SpamBlockers Documentation Website Builds

This branch is where the documentation site resources are fall here. All of the builds are
handled by GitHub Actions as defined in the `.github/workflows/Deploy.gh-pages.yml` at the `master` branch
of this repo.

If you want to create a MR, please stop pointing the target branch here from your own `gh-pages` of your fork
as this might mess the things up.
